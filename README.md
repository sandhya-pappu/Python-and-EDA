# Python-and-Exploratory Design Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory DATA Analysis plays a major role because once you source the data, it is essential to get rid of the irregularities in the data and fix it to improve its quality.
One can encounter different kinds of issues in a dataset. 
Irregularities may appear in the form of missing values, anomalies/outliers, incorrect format and inconsistent spelling, etc., 
These irregularities may propagate further and affect the assumptions and analysis based on that dataset and may hamper the further process of machine learning model building. 
Hence, data cleaning is a very important step in EDA.

SO in this repository, we perform data cleaning and many other techniques of EDA like-
  Data Sourcing - Quick analysis of the data after loading from different sources.
  Data Cleaning - Identifying missing values and outliers and then handle the missing data. 
  Univariative Analysis - It deals with analysing a single column/variable.
  Bi-variative and Multi-variative Analysis - the analysis of two variables/columns in the data set.
